# Community FAQ

## General Privacy Questions

### Can I get my data removed using 3rd party services?

There are several services which search your email for proof we process your data.
In fact, these services usually find outdated email of subscriptions to mailing lists
or similar which are usually no longer accurate.
Since we are not in the business in collecting your data, standardized, generic requests
made from these services are refused as they are overly broad, excessive and
usually unfounded in accordance with [GDPR, Article 12 Item 5](https://gdpr-text.com/read/article-12/#para_gdpr-a-12_5-1).

If you were a committer, have subscribed to our mailing lists or similar, please reach out directly
and we will try to resolve your issue.
