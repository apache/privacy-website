The following information will be collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:</p>

<ul>

<p>The retention time for this data is 90 days.</p>

<p>The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above.
In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you.
In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when visiting our website.

<h4 id="matomo">Matomo</h4>

<p>In addition to logfiles, some of our websites use Matomo to understand what parts of the 
website are important to our users, what features are most frequently read up on, 
where users get lost in the documentation, etc. 
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website, 
and the docs and where to focus improvements next.</p>

<p>The collected information consists of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The IP address from which you access the website</li>
