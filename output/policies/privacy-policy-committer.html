<h2 id="2-collection-and-storage-of-personal-data-and-the-nature-and-purpose-of-their-use">2. Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use</h2>

<p>We need to collect some of your information. This is necessary to 
make sure contributions to our codebases or other crucial parts of the ASF 
have a clean IP.</p>

<h3 id="1-information-submitted-voluntarily-on-the-icla-form">1. Information submitted voluntarily on the ICLA form</h3>

<h4 id="full-name">Full name</h4>

<p>This is your name that you use to sign legal documents. The name is 
visible to the secretary team, the system administrators, and you. 
It is not shared with others. It is used as the legal basis for the ICLA contract.
The full name will be made to the public, except you choose a public name.</p>

<h4 id="public-name">Public name</h4>

<p>This is your name as known to the public. If you are voted as a committer, this name will 
be shown along with your Apache id at https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html
You can choose the public freely and keep your identity anonymous to the public.</p>

<p>The public name is also used for internal toolings without any restriction.</p>

<h4 id="postal-address">Postal Address</h4>

<p>This is your personal residence. It is used only to disambiguate your document from 
others which may have the same or similar name. It is visible to the secretary team 
and system administrators.</p>

<h4 id="country">Country</h4>

<p>This is the country of your personal residence. It is used only to disambiguate 
your document from others which may have the same or similar name. It is visible 
to the secretary team, system administrators, and you.</p>

<h4 id="email">Email</h4>

<p>This is the forwarding address for mail received at your ASF email address. 
This E-Mail adress can be changed later at your own will. However, it will remain on our documents.</p>

<h4 id="preferred-apache-id">Preferred Apache ID</h4>

<p>This may be used to create your Apache account. It is visible to the public 
once your account is created (see Public Name above).</p>

<p>Please note: it is very difficult, if not impossible, to change the Apache ID. If you need
privacy, please don’t use your real name or any other personal data for your ID.</p>

<h4 id="notify-project">Notify project</h4>

<p>This may be used to create your Apache account. The project you might join first
will be notified.</p>

<h3 id="2-information-submitted-voluntarily-by-sending-email-to-a-public-apache-email-list">2. Information submitted voluntarily by sending email to a public Apache email list</h3>

<p>The entire email, including your “from” address, the subject, and body of the email 
are archived and are publicly visible and searchable. Additionally, copies of your email 
are made available to a number of publicly archived and publicly searchable internet sites. 
You should never include any personal information in emails sent to public Apache email lists.</p>

<p>Please also see: <a href="/policies/mailinglist-policy.html">Mailing List Policy</a></p>

<h3 id="3-the-asf-does-not-ever-sell-any-personal-information">3. The ASF does not ever sell any personal information.</h3>

<p>The Apache Software Foundation does not sell any personal information.</p>
