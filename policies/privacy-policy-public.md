##  2. Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use

### a) When visiting the website

#### Log files 

When you visit our websites ([full list of domains](/policies/asf-domains.html)) or one of our subdomains,
the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website.
This information is temporarily stored in a log file.
The following information is be collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:

 - The IP address of the requesting computer
 - The date and time of access
 - The name and URL of the retrieved file
 - The website from which access is made (referrer URL)
 - Geo information of the location from which access is made
 - The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer and the name of your access provider

The data mentioned are processed by us for the following purposes:

 - Ensuring a smooth connection of the website
 - Ensuring comfortable use of our website
 - Evaluation of system security and stability
 - Other administrative purposes

The retention time for this data is 90 days.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above.
In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you.
In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when you visit our website.
Further details can be found under no. 4 and 5 of this privacy policy.

#### Matomo

In addition to log files, some of our websites use Matomo to understand what parts of the 
website are important to our users, what features are most frequently accessed, 
where users get lost in the documentation, etc. 
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website, 
and the docs and where to focus improvements next.

The collected information consists of the following:

 - The IP address from which you access the website
 - The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site
 - The date and time you access our site
 - The pages you visit
 - If you click on any of the file download links on our website
 - The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site
 - The addresses of pages you go to from our site
 - The search terms you use on the website

This information is gathered and stored using the open source software Matomo. We don’t 
use any cookies to collect this information. An IP address is anonymized by removing 
the last two octets from the IP address. That means that if your IP is 192.168.100.50, 
we store it as 192.168.0.0.

Matomo is self-hosted on a virtual machine provided by the Apache Software Foundation. 
It can only be accessed by members of the Apache Privacy committee. The data can be 
viewed by anyone by visiting https://analytics.apache.org/.

Matomo respects any Do Not Track setting in your browser. You can also opt-out 
from all Matomo tracking below.

### b) When registering for our newsletter and mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented, 
we use your e-mail address to periodically send you our newsletter.
For the receipt of the newsletter the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

We inform our visitors at regular intervals through newsletters about news and offers from The Apache Software Foundation.

The newsletter of our Foundation can only be received if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person befoer the first time of sending the newsletter, using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address is the person who authorized the receipt of the newsletter.

When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected person's e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for the newsletter is used exclusively to send our newsletter. 

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter/mailing list or technical changes. 

There will be no transfer to third parties of the personal data collected as part of the newsletter service.

Subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
Consent to the storage of personal data that the person has given us for the newsletter dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of each newsletter email. 

### c) When registering for our mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented, we use your e-mail address to send you messages arriving at our mailing lists.
For the receipt of the mailing list message the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

Visitors may communicate with us through our mailing lists.

The mailing list messages of our organisation can only be received if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the mailing list.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person for the first time using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address authorized the receipt of the mailing list messages.

When you subscribe to a mailing list, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected person's e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.
When a mailing list is archived, the log file will be deleted.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for a mailing list will be used exclusively to send messages arriving at that mailing list. 

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the mailing list service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the mailing list or other technical changes. 

We will not actively transfer to third parties any personal data as part of the mailing list service.
However, almost all of our mailing lists are of a public nature.

This means, your name and email may be exposed to the public.
Also, all information you send to a mailing list will be exposed to the public.
Third parties may collect this information and process it separately.
The sender of messages is responsible if they expose their personal data to the public.

All content sent to mailing lists is archived indefinitely.
